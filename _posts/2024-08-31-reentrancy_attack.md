A **reentrancy attack** is not foodâ€”it's a type of security vulnerability that can occur in computer programs, especially in **smart contracts** on blockchain platforms like Ethereum.

### What is a Reentrancy Attack?

A reentrancy attack exploits the way a smart contract handles external calls to other contracts. Here's how it typically works:

1. **Smart Contract Makes an External Call**: A smart contract (let's call it **Contract A**) sends a message or calls a function on another contract (let's call it **Contract B**). During this call, **Contract A** is in a temporary, incomplete state.

2. **Malicious Contract Exploits Reentrancy**: If **Contract B** is malicious or controlled by an attacker, it can use this opportunity to make a recursive call back to **Contract A** before the initial call is finished and before the state of **Contract A** is updated.

3. **Reentrant Call Drains Funds or Manipulates State**: The recursive call allows the attacker to manipulate the state of **Contract A** in a way that benefits them. For example, if **Contract A** was handling money transfers, the attacker could repeatedly call back into **Contract A** and withdraw funds multiple times before **Contract A** updates its balance.

### How Does This Relate to Smart Contracts?

In smart contracts, reentrancy attacks can be particularly damaging because:

- **Lack of State Update Before the Reentrant Call**: If the contract does not update its state (e.g., deducting the balance of a user after a withdrawal) before making an external call, an attacker can drain the contract's funds.
- **Decentralization and Irreversibility**: Blockchain transactions are irreversible, making it very hard to recover funds once they have been stolen.

### Example of a Reentrancy Attack

A famous example of a reentrancy attack is the attack on **The DAO** in 2016, where an attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability to drain about **$60 million** worth of Ether from the DAO smart contract.

### Preventing Reentrancy Attacks

To prevent reentrancy attacks, developers can:

- **Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: Update the contract's state variables before making any external calls.
- **Implement Reentrancy Guards**: Use special coding patterns or libraries (like OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` in Solidity) to prevent functions from being called recursively.

In summary, a reentrancy attack is a cybersecurity exploit related to smart contracts and has nothing to do with food. It's a critical concept in the world of blockchain development and security.
